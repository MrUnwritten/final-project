            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hey there, my name is Victor, glad you stumbled on by. Where to start? Oh yeah
                obviously gaming.
            <br>
            As a kid, gaming was all I had because my dad always told me it was homework first
            then I could play games but could never go out or have friends because that was a distraction.
            <br>
            So for a while, I was always top of my class but then I started realizing I wasn't as happy as people thought I was 
            especially having tons of games.
            <br>
            And to break out of that I came up with a loop hole in my dads rules if I can't go out and have friends why not make friends on games.
            <br>
            Immediately went out and tried earning money for a cheap gaming headset by selling my snacks/sodas, mowing lawns, and even cleaning cars.
            <br>
            And when I got my first ever headset I felt like I was above the world. Making friends left and right on games I loved.
            <br>
            After a while my dad saw that I was happier and still keeping my grades up and changed his mind.
            <br> 
            But I knew at that moment in life gaming was going to be a huge part of my life.
            <br>
            And if I could give anyone any type of advice it would be don't let anyone stop you from doing the things
            you love!
            <br>
             Stay Positive, look for solutions, and never give up no matter how many times you fall
             just get up and push forward!
